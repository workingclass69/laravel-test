# Instructions
    Set up the database in the .env file
    Run php artisan serve and npm run dev for the laravel and tailwind server

# My Approach
    I used jquery for the blade templates and used the existing api endpoints for simplicity. 
    I usually use a a javascript framework for the frontend like react or vue and 
    use laravel as an api server which it does great.
